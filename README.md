# Spaceship
 A game made with Lua and Love2d

This game was a group project in our first-semester English class. We were supposed to come up with an idea for an educational game and present it to the entire class. We decided to keep our idea simple and go an extra step and program it. Our team consisted of 3 people. An artist and 2 programmers. I had previously played around with the game development framework Love2d which uses Lua as its programming language, so I suggested it to the team, and we agreed to use it. We worked on this for around 3â€“4 weeks. The idea for the game came from my struggle to learn the articles of German words (der/die/das). You basically control a spaceship and have to shoot one of two balloons. One has the right article, and one has the wrong one.
The project was a bit challenging and therefore lots of fun, especially since we were all first-semester students and didn't have any experience.
