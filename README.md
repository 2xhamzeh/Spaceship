# Spaceship
 A game made with Lua and love2d

This game was a group project in our first semester English class. We were supposed to come up with an idea for an educational game and present it to the entire class. We decided to keep our idea simple and go an extra step and programm it. Our team consisted of 3 people. An artist and 2 programmers. I had previously played around with the game development framework love2d which uses lua as its programming language so I suggested it to the team and we agreed to use it. We worked on this for around 3-4 weeks. The idea of the game came from my struggle of learning the articels of german words (der/die/das). You basically control a spaceship and have to shoot one of two balloons. One has the right article and one has the wrong one.
The project was a bit challenging and therefor lots of fun, espically since we were all firt semester students and didn't have any experience.
